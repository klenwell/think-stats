Chapter 4 | Exercise 1
======================
How much did you weigh at birth? If you donâ€™t know, call your mother or someone else who
knows. Using the NSFG data (all live births), compute the distribution of birth weights
and use it to find your percentile rank. If you were a first baby, find your percentile
rank in the distribution for first babies. Otherwise use the distribution for others. If
you are in the 90th percentile or higher, call your mother back and apologize.

my birth weight: {{ my_birth_weight }}
percentile rank (all births): {{ "%.1f" | format(live_percentile_rank) }}
percentile rank (first births): {{ "%.1f" | format(first_percentile_rank) }}
percentile rank (other births): {{ "%.1f" | format(other_percentile_rank) }}
