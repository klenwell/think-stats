Chapter 5 | Exercise 1
======================
In the BRFSS (see Section 5.4), the distribution of heights is roughly normal
with parameters µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm for men, and µ = 163 cm and σ = 7.3 cm
for women.

In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5’10” and 6’1”
(see http://bluemancasting.com). What percentage of the U.S. male population is
in this range? Hint: use scipy.stats.norm.cdf.

Total Males: {{ num_males }}
CDF Percentage (vs Actual): {{ "%.1f" | format(cdf_pct * 100) }}% ({{ "%.1f" | format(actual_pct * 100) }}%)
CDF Count (vs Actual): {{ "%.1f" | format(cdf_count) }} ({{ actual_count }})
